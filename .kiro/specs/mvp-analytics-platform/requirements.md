# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MVP Analytics Platform is a streamlined, role-based analytics platform that demonstrates the value of centralized data insights through manual data entry. This serves as a proof-of-concept for director approval and full development authorization. The platform consolidates project data in role-specific dashboards to eliminate manual reporting, speed up decision-making, and provide previously unavailable insights.
