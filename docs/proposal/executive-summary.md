# ðŸ§¾ **Executive Summary â€” Insight Hub**

## ðŸ“Œ **What is Insight Hub?**

**Insight Hub** is a quotation-to-invoice automation and analytics platform built for **project-based businesses** â€” especially those operating in South Africaâ€™s **tendering ecosystem** with **government departments and municipalities**.

It helps SMEs streamline their quoting and billing process, manage their equipment pool, and make smarter business decisions through **real-time financial insights**.

---

## ðŸš€ **The Problem**

Small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in project-driven sectors struggle to:

* Track **which projects or clients generate the most income**
* Convert quotes to invoices with project-specific pricing
* Analyze **item-level profitability** or make pricing decisions quickly
* Handle **ad-hoc RFQs** that donâ€™t fit neatly into their project workflow
* Make growth decisions based on **up-to-date, actionable data**

---

## âœ… **Our Solution**

Insight Hub bridges the gap between project operations and financial clarity by:

* Managing **project-linked inventory and item pricing**
* Supporting both **registered projects** and **ad-hoc RFQs**
* Linking every **quote and invoice** to the right context (project, client, item)
* Delivering **dashboard reports at a glance** â€” revenue, usage, quote-to-invoice ratios, and more
* Providing **role-specific access** and **full change logs** for transparency and accountability
