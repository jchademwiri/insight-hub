* API endpoints or Server Actions
* Database schema (Drizzle ORM table definitions)
* Folder structure (Next.js App Router conventions)
* State management decisions (e.g. local state, context, or form libraries)

✅ *Deliverable format:* Markdown, Notion, or a shared doc.

**Purpose:** Organize the build into sprints or milestones.
**Includes:**

* Tasks grouped by phase: Auth, Projects, Dashboards, etc.
* Status (To Do / In Progress / Done)
* Time estimates
* Assignments (if you're working with a team)

✅ *Tool examples:* Trello, Linear, Notion, GitHub Projects

---

## ✅ 5. **Testing Plan**

**Purpose:** Ensure you're building what works and is testable manually.
**Includes:**

* Manual test cases for each feature (e.g. “Submit Project Form → should redirect & show new project”)
* Acceptance criteria per feature
* Device/browser checklist (especially tablet support)
* Edge cases (missing data, invalid inputs, etc.)

## ✅ 7. **Deployment & Environment Plan**

**Purpose:** Set up production-ready workflows from day one.
**Includes:**

* Hosting setup (Vercel project link, env variables)
* Supabase project setup & secrets
* Branching strategy (main/dev)
* CI/CD steps (Vercel deploy previews, linting, type checking)

✅ *Tip:* Document `.env` variable names & values clearly

---

## ✅ 8. **Content/Data Strategy (Manual Entry Plan)**

**Purpose:** Plan how you’ll populate the system for demo/testing.
**Includes:**

## ✅ 9. **Presentation Deck (for Director/Stakeholders)**

**Purpose:** When the MVP is ready, you'll need a clean presentation.
**Includes:**

* MVP goals recap
