## **1. Executive Summary**

This proposal presents a plan to build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of a **role-based analytics platform** for construction/project-based companies. The MVP will use **manual data entry workflows** to simulate real-world scenarios and validate the business value of consolidated project dashboards.

The goal is to secure **director approval** and initial funding for a fully integrated, automated analytics platform, by demonstrating measurable value with minimal initial investment.

## **2. Vision & Purpose**

Modern operations across construction, logistics, and infrastructure sectors suffer from fragmented reporting and siloed insights. Our vision is to consolidate financial, operational, and project data into **centralized dashboards** tailored to user roles ‚Äî improving transparency, operational awareness, and decision speed.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è **Key Value Propositions:**

* Centralized, role-based visibility of business health
* Faster and data-driven decision-making
* Elimination of manual, Excel-based reporting
* Early risk detection and performance analysis
* Foundation for full digital transformation
